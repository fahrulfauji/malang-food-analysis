# 📓 Notebooks Folder

This folder is reserved for Jupyter Notebooks, especially if interactive analysis or advanced exploration is required.

In this project, most of the analysis was conducted using Python scripts (.py), while the notebooks folder is reserved for later development.

---

## Project Structure Overview

The analysis in this project was conducted using:

- Python scripts → `scripts/python_visualization/`
- SQL files → `scripts/sql_analysis/`
- Excel documentation → `scripts/excel_cleaning/`

This approach was chosen to practice a structured and reproducible analysis workflow.

## Why Python Scripts Instead of Notebooks?

As a beginner in data analysis, I chose to use Python scripts first before moving on to Jupyter Notebooks.

Reasons:

### 1. Clear Structure & Discipline
- Scripts encourage a clear execution flow
- Helps develop a habit of writing clean and modular code
- Avoids random cell execution (hidden state)

### 2. Version Control Friendly
- Easier to track in Git
- Code changes are clearly visible in commits
- Avoids notebook file conflicts

### 3. Reproducibility
- Scripts can be rerun from scratch
- Doesn't rely on interactive state
- Closer to the workflow in a real-world environment

### 4. Learning Focus
- Focus on Python fundamentals (pandas, numpy, visualization)
- Practice analytical logic, not just visual exploration
- Build coding habits before interactive exploration

## Analysis Files Location

### Python Analysis
- `scripts/python_visualization/simple_analysis.py`
→ Main script for analysis and visualization
- `scripts/python_visualization/requirements.txt` 
→ Dependency list

### SQL Analysis
- `scripts/sql_analysis/database_schema.sql`
- `scripts/sql_analysis/simple_queries.sql`
- `scripts/sql_analysis/import_instructions.md`

### Excel Processing
- `scripts/excel_cleaning/data_cleaning_steps.md`

## When Would I Use Jupyter Notebooks?

Jupyter Notebooks will be used when:

- Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization experiments
- Tutorials or learning documentation
- Analysis requiring interactive narrative

---

## Future Use of This Folder

The `notebooks/` folder is set up for:

1. Advanced exploratory analysis
2. Practice intermediate–advanced pandas
3. SQL + Python integration
4. Learning notebooks
5. Future machine learning experiments

---

## Project Outputs

This project produces:

- Python visualizations in the `outputs/` folder
- SQL queries and their results
- Business insights in the `insights/` folder
- Complete documentation of the analysis process

---

## Learning Path

This project represents the initial stages of the data analysis learning journey:

1. Script-based analysis (current focus)
2. Exploratory analysis with notebooks
3. Combining scripts & notebooks
4. More advanced analysis techniques
