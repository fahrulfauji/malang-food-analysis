### 2. Pricing & Rating Observations
- Most restaurants have ratings above 4.0.
- No strong correlation was found between menu prices and ratings in this simple analysis.
- Higher prices do not always translate to higher ratings.

### 3. Category Distribution
- The menu is fairly evenly distributed between:
- Side dishes / protein
- Carbohydrates
- Complements / side dishes
- This indicates that menu variation is a common practice.
